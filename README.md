# JPMC Task 1
Starter repo for task 1 of the JPMC software engineering program

Run server.py and client.py (in that order) and I noticed two things:\
(1) The Ratio in the client output is always 1\
(2) The price of each stock is always the same as its bid

These are obviously wrong, So my job is to fix them.

The changes i made in the following methods of the file (client.py):\
(1) getDataPoint\
(2) getRatio\
(3) Main
